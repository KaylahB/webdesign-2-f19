	<p>Ella Jane Fitzgerald was born in Newport News, Va. on April 25, 1917. Her father, William, and mother, Temperance (Tempie), parted ways shortly after her birth. Together, Tempie and Ella went to Yonkers, N.Y, where they eventually moved in with Tempie’s longtime boyfriend Joseph Da Silva. Ella’s half-sister, Frances, was born in 1923 and soon she began referring to Joe as her stepfather.
To support the family, Joe dug ditches and was a part-time chauffeur, while Tempie worked at a laundromat and did some catering.

		<p>Their apartment was in a mixed neighborhood, where Ella made friends easily. She considered herself more of a tomboy, and often joined in the neighborhood games of baseball. Sports aside, she enjoyed dancing and singing with her friends, and some evenings they would take the train into Harlem and watch various acts at the Apollo Theater.
In 1932, Tempie died from serious injuries that she received in a car accident.  </p>

	<div class ="columns_2"><p>The present state of archaeological and anthropological knowledge suggests that the builders of the hypogea (underground tombs) lived in the mountain slopes and valleys in the area. In the valleys they established small settlements whereas on the hillsides settlement was dispersed, close to the fields. The oval-plan residential sites were built on artificial terraces, with rammed earth floors. The wooden frames were filled with wattle-and-daub and the roofs were thatched. There were no internal divisions and there was a single combustion zone, with wooden benches for sleeping.</p>

<p>The Spaniards called the region Tierradentro, suggested to be either because of the mountainous topography of the area, which generates the sensation of being closed in, or perhaps following the same theme, because of the numerous funerary Hypogea cut from the rock, filled with funerary remains and soil, so that the inhabitants were literally buried ‘Dentro da Tierra’ both within the Hypogea and the mountains surrounding them.</p> </div>

	<div class ="columns_2"><p>The National Archaeological Park of Tierradentro is well known for its pre-Columbian hypogea, which were found in several excavations and in various archeological locations.</p>

		<p>The typical hypogeum has an entry oriented towards the west, a spiral staircase and a main chamber, usually 5 to 8 meters below the surface, with several lesser chambers around, each one containing a corpse. The walls are painted with geometric, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic patterns in red, black and white. Some statues and remains of pottery and fabrics can be seen scarcely due to grave robbery before the hypogea were constituted as protected areas.</p>

<p>The precolumbian culture that created this funeral complex inhabited this area during the first millennium A.C. Tierradentro Archaeological park features hypogea dating from 6th to 9th centuries AD. The details in the sculptures and pictoric patterns are similar to the San Agustín culture. </p> </div>

<p>If you want to try some other places to eat, your choices are limited. La Portada 
has the best (and only) restaurant in San Andrés, but there are a few limited 
choices by the park entrance about a 20 minute walk downhill. They didn’t look 
	appealing at all.</p>

<p>After one hike, there was a woman who set up a tent on the corner near La 
Portada. She was offering a local stew called mote. We decided to sit and try this 
meal, which is basically like traditional Colombian sancocho but with corn and 
beans instead of vegetables. Our meal cost COP$16,000 for two including drinks. </p> </div>
